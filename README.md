Any feedback is appreciated.
I don't know much about coding, but I'd like to improve.

Default language is English, but some sections are in italian/english only
Most of the game info has been translated/transcribed by myself, so mistakes are surely present.

Elements not in SRD are not included, unless I included some by mistake. If that has happened, I will make sure to remove them.

As this is my first project in Java, some areas surely contain mistakes. I have benefited from online forums and AI. As my skills improve, I will make sure to improve the overall quality of the code.
In any case, almost nothing has been blindly copied, I have reviewed everything, bar a few exceptions (marked as such) that I will review.

Some elements, such as spells, are automatically parsed using python, so they may contain errors.

If you want to include custom elements, you can do so by creating files inside a "custom" folder created inside the "resources" folder with the same structure as "groups, miscs, translations or definitions" (more will be added).
Note that in case of duplicate values, the ones in custom will take priority. Also, avoid duplicate translated names (such as SHIELD=Shield and SPELL_SHIELD=Shield) as that leads to errors.
