Any feedback is appreciated.
I don't know much about coding, but I'd like to improve.

Default language is English, but some sections are in italian/english only
Most of the game info has been translated/transcribed by myself, so mistakes are surely present.

Elements not in SRD are not included, unless I included some by mistake. If that has happened, I will make sure to remove them.

As this is my first project in Java, some areas surely contain mistakes. I have benefited from online forums and AI. As my skills improve, I will make sure to improve the overall quality of the code.
In any case, almost nothing has been blindly copied, I have reviewed everything, bar a few exceptions (marked as such) that I will review.

Some elements, such as spells, are automatically parsed using python, so they may contain errors
