Any feedback is appreciated.
I don't know much about coding, but I'd like to improve.

Default language is Italian. More languages can and will be added. Though some tweaking may be necessary.
Most of the game info has been translated/transcribed by myself, so some mistakes are present.

Elements not in OGL are not included, unless I included some by mistake. If that has happened, I will make sure to remove them.

As this is my first project in Java, some areas surely contain mistakes. I have benefited from online forums and AI. As my skills improve, I will make sure to improve the overall quality of the code.
In any case, almost nothing has been blindly copied, I have reviewed everything, bar a few exceptions (marked as such) that I will review.
